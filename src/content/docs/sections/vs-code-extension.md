description: Using the VS Code Extension

Most of the features of the VS Code extension are documented on the classic [documentation site](https://docs.relational.ai/rkgms/vs-code-extension).

However, there is one new feature worth mentioning here that is not documented at the link above: the Rel Profiler. The profiler shows a breakdown of how the query evaluation time was spent.

If you open the *Transactions* log, you'll see a list of your transactions, from most recent to least recent. Click on a transaction to see a detailed view of it. The last option is *Open Transaction Profile*. Click on that to see a detailed profile of the transaction.
